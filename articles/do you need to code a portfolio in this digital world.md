  If you don't know the meaning of **`Portfolio`**; this is what Google says:

> A portfolio is a collection of academic and professional materials that showcase your beliefs, skills, qualifications, education, training, and experiences.

Now, let's talk about portfolios, specifically for developers planning to create their own.

In this massive digital world, where everyone has their own little corner filled with numerous social URLs; having a portfolio is crucial. 
However, it's **not mandatory to code it**, a point that many of us fail to understand.

There are tools available that can help you in building your portfolio without any coding. After all, coding to make your unique one takes a lot of effort because poorly constructed portfolios can leave a negative impression.

In my experience of 2 years, having a portfolio or an equivalent platform is important. However, coding it isn't necessary at all.

I understand the feeling & thrill that creating a portfolio brings, but people in the early stages with very little to showcase can use platforms like GitHub as a substitute for a portfolio.

**What do you guys think?** Share your thoughts on these two questions:

1. Do we need a portfolio?
2. If we choose to have a portfolio, is coding it necessary?

I encourage you to share your experiences and opinions in the comments!

Next week, I am planning to write a post that will prove that you don't need to code a portfolio and will discover ways where you can make yours in less than an hour.
I'm not kidding, so keep an eye out for that.

I'm not suggesting you shouldn't create a portfolio, but if you do, make it truly unique so it's worth the time invested.

Personally, I don't have a separate portfolio; my [GitHub](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal) serves as my development portfolio.

If you're considering creating your portfolio, here are a few resources:

- [300+ Portfolios](https://portfolio-ideas.vercel.app/) - Highly recommended

Until next time :)
