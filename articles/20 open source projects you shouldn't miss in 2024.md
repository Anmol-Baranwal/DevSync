  <hr />
  Today, I've got some cool open-source projects you can contribute in 2024. These aren't just popular projects; I've come across these during my two-year journey.

There are various ways to contribute to a project. 
I've seen people only looking at the tech stack but I recommend choosing the one whose concept excites you rather than only following the tech stack. 

> Something that excites you will help you move forward especially when you're stuck.

I know lists can be boring because no one wants to see the list of projects and then forget about it. 
So, I will also mention the use cases and then you can decide which project suits you.

You can find awesome lists at the end of the article with 300+ open source projects.

But, before contributing to any open source project, we must ensure that it is decent enough as per standards.

## How to check if the open source project is good?

There is no right answer to this but every good open source project must have clear guidelines to help you on `HOW` you can contribute to their project (`contributing.md`) and a few [other requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories). 

![community standards](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1k9yvhyk2wls1mjnzak0.png)

Just remember, there's no specific order in this post. Every open-source project is good in its own way.

## 1. [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/)

Exercism is a website where you can learn various programming languages, help others, and even get testimonials.

This is my favorite open source project due to multiple reasons.

There are various tracks, and almost every programming language is there. 

- https://exercism.org - website
- https://github.com/exercism/ - GitHub

![Exercism](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fzv966pqdd3iu9ox1ljh.png)

The reason is everything you do such as `reviewing Pull Requests`, and `Pull Requests created & merged` is publicly shown on your profile and you even get badges for various achievements.

![Contribution in exercism](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ugwsy31xf4ha9fr3oq3w.png)

You can even see my [profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/Anmol-Baranwal). 

As you can see everything is publicly available that will help you showcase your skills.

It's a new programming language for powerful data computing, which can work as a high-efficiency data warehouse.
