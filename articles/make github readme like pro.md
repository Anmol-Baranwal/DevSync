## Badges

These can be easily added to your profile using standardized [badges/shields](https://github.com/badges/shields)
These can be used for various reasons like showing your expertise, and the overall stats.
While not compulsory, they are a huge bonus and can even be used to show the activity of a repository with commits per month, the number of maintainers, or skills.
