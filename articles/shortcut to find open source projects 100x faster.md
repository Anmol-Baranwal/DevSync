  <hr />
  Today, I've got **8 ways** that can help you find your **dream open-source project**.

Before delving into the nitty gritty on how to find open-source projects, let's first understand what open-source means.

## Open Source is more than merging a PR

In a world where we are more connected than ever, being a part of an open-source community can be the key to unlocking new opportunities and achieving personal growth.

For me, it's an opportunity to make a difference without needing a job, leaving an impact on millions of users.

You **Code**. **Collaborate**. **Network**.

But most important of all, you're welcome, and you interact with experienced people all the time.

Tip: Pick good organizations rather than individual repositories for long-term benefit.

I have made _200+ Pull Requests_ and participated in over _400 discussions_, so I am familiar with what is required and the standards of good open-source projects.

Most people struggle with how to find good open-source projects. This article provides numerous options tailored to be a perfect fit for you.

## 1. [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending)

You can find trending repositories based on `Spoken Language`, `Programming Language` and `Date`.

These are all the elite repositories that can boost your credibility and reputation in open-source community.

## 3. [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)

If you're starting with open source, don't make it more complex than it is. 

Remember, issues suitable for new contributors are often labeled as `good first issue` or `help wanted`, helping you make your first contribution to open-source. 

You can find several good first issues with the option to choose your preferred `language` through a friendly user interface.

This option is one of the most popular websites to find good open-source projects.

You can filter by `name` and `label`, such as `good first issues`, and explore `popular tags` like `opencv` and `android`. Additionally, you can check when the repository was last updated.

## 6. [Quine](https://quine.sh/contribute)

Quine helps you monetize your reputation by contributing to open source. They have their leaderboard, quests, and so many innovative features.

You can search for projects without signing up, but I highly recommend you sign up and explore. 

The standout feature is that it displays PR merge time in hours, shows how many new contributors there are for the current month, and details the types of issues. It provides a clear idea about the project.

From my experience, I can say that the benefits of contributing to organizations are much more than individual repositories.

You must have heard about Google Summer of Code, in which reputable organizations participate.
