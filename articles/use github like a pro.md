  After examining over 400 GitHub profiles and utilizing the platform for nearly a year, I have discovered the resources to save countless hours of research.

"GitHub isn't just a tool for improving your coding skills - it's a way to enhance your collaboration, communication, and problem-solving abilities."

## Part 3 Series

In this three-part series, I will guide you through the mandatory requirements for mastering GitHub, including basic terminology, markdown, and GitHub actions. Next, I will provide resources to help elevate your GitHub profile to a professional level. Finally, I will offer miscellaneous tips and a concluding note to cap off this exciting journey.

## Why bother learning these?

Your GitHub profile is your digital identity as a developer, and your Profile README is a unique opportunity to showcase your personality, skills, and projects in a way that is both informative and engaging. But let's be honest: most README files are boring and forgettable. So why not make yours stand out?

Think of your Profile README as your brand statement. It's a chance to tell your story, highlight your strengths, and showcase your creativity. Start with an eye-catching headline that sums up who you are and what you do. Then, use the rest of the document to provide a brief overview of your background and experience, including any notable projects you've worked on or contributions you've made to the development community.

Whatever approach you take, remember that your Profile README is a reflection of you as a person and a developer. So be authentic, be creative, and make it something that truly represents who you are.

Knowing certain skills and resources is essential for transforming your vision into a reality. 
Let's explore deeper into these key elements more.

## Markdown

Markdown is essential for GitHub because this simple yet versatile markup language allows users to create visually stunning and informative documentation for their projects. 
GitHub supports Markdown formatting in the readme files, issues, pull requests, and other areas, making it an integral part of the development process. 
By familiarizing yourself with the basics, you'll be able to effortlessly communicate and collaborate with fellow developers on the platform.

> This comprehensive [cheat sheet](https://cheatography.com//simon-fermor/cheat-sheets/markdown/pdf/) covers all the essentials you need to know.

> And if you ever find yourself in a bind, don't hesitate to refer back to this handy [Markdown reference guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) which I use for quick and easy access to syntax and formatting rules.

## GitHub Actions

> This is not mandatory but you will have to use it later for sure.

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool provided by GitHub, which allows developers to automate their workflows and build, test, and deploy their code directly from GitHub. 

Furthermore, GitHub Actions can be used to implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), which are essential practices in modern software development.

> [Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to learn more about GitHub actions

To get started, take a look at these [Sample Workflows](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/Awesome-Illustrations-4Projects/tree/main/.github/workflows) which are appropriate for learning.
And if you need any assistance along the way, don't hesitate to reach out to ChatGPT or official docs, to understand the code.

## Basic terminologies of a GitHub repository

If you're new to GitHub, you may feel overwhelmed by all the jargon and terminology that gets thrown around. But fear not! With a little bit of guidance, you'll soon be navigating your way around repositories like a pro.

First up, it's important to understand the [basic flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) of GitHub and how code is created and used. 

Once you've got that down, you can start delving into the details of a standard repository, including:

&nbsp;

### 1. README.md: 
A README file is a document that provides information about a repository, including its purpose, installation instructions, and usage examples. And with Markdown formatting, it's easy to make your README look great.
> .md is for markdown extension

This is what a nicely documented readme looks like

&nbsp;

### 2. Issues: 
Issues are used to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to a project. 
They can be opened by anyone and allow developers to track and prioritize work that needs to be done. 
Issues can be assigned to specific team members, labeled with specific tags, and can have discussions related to them.

> Take a look at these [examples](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/Awesome-Illustrations-4Projects/issues)

&nbsp;

### 3. Code of Conduct: 
A must-have for any inclusive and welcoming community, a Code of Conduct sets out guidelines for expected behavior and helps ensure that everyone feels safe and respected.

> Take a look at [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/Awesome-Illustrations-4Projects/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Adding a code of conduct is part of the community standards checklist for any GitHub repository.

&nbsp;

### 4. License: 
Use a license to outline the terms and conditions for using and distributing your repository's code.
GitHub provides a variety of open-source licenses that can be used by developers.

Learn more about [LICENSE](https://gist.github.com/nicolasdao/a7adda51f2f185e8d2700e1573d8a633)
Take a look at the official [GitHub blog](https://github.com/readme/guides/open-source-licensing)

> I am not covering contributing.md & pull_request_template.md since you don't need to know these as a beginner.

&nbsp;

Whew! That was a lot, I know. 

If you're feeling a little overwhelmed, don't worry! Take your time and use these resources to guide you along the way. And before you know it, you'll be navigating GitHub repositories like a pro.
