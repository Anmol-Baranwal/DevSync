  I can guarantee that this is the only post you need to learn everything about Headless CMS (CMS stands for Content Management System).

In case you do not know what the term means, see this video by Simen Svale (Founder of Sanity):

You can also see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGMo1XCNQMo) to understand Headless CMS in 1 minute or read this detailed [blog](https://www.contentful.com/headless-cms/#:~:text=in%20your%20browser.-,What%20is%20a%20headless%20CMS%3F,any%20digital%20channel%20you%20choose) by Contentful.

Let me explain.
In short - It's just any backend application, which is 100% built upon APIs. Headless means -> frontend less body. That can be attached to any frontend/Head.

Let's see what we can do with Headless CMS using examples from popular software. 

Till the end, you will get an overall idea of how to use Headless CMS to build amazing things.

---

## 1. [OneEntry](https://oneentry.cloud/)

For the first example, I will take OneEntry, one of the most feature-rich CMS systems I have seen.

## Why OneEntry shines

It provides APIs, npm, and SDK for JavaScript & SWIFT for effortless frontend integration. 

We can do almost anything with JavaScript even program our smartwatch. 
Offering an SDK for JS makes OneEntry the secret sauce for building amazing products.

Additionally, you get PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB bases with virtual storage on modern and powerful servers.

One of the most overlooked things that OneEntry solves is that you can easily export products and services from YML or CSV files. 

It also offers bulk uploading and automatic image optimization.

It can seamlessly integrate with any third-party systems, including payment services, and utilize exceptionally fast SSDs and powerful servers.

> It even has an easy module for `authentication with JWT` for your website.

You can watch the video to understand why you don't have to worry about using it with any frameworks/tools, such as Next.js, Angular, Java, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Vue, and React.

&nbsp;

## OneEntry goes above and beyond

OneEntry offers a very **simple user interface**, so you don't need to be a tech guy to use it.

Surprisingly, it doesn't require the installation of extra plugins. What more could we even ask for?

**Data validation** in OneEntry involves thorough checks to reduce errors and ensure data meets criteria, maintaining accurate and reliable datasets.

OneEntry uses **cloud technology** for secure data storage. It provides strong system protection from DDoS attacks, viruses, and data loss.

Enjoy peace of mind with automatic **data backup and logging**. Each plan has **SSL certificate**, which improves credibility.

It also has an integrated Statistics system and A/B Testing. You can scale your application without additional time & costs.

Plus, it provides ready-to-use solutions and tools for executing any E-commerce project.

&nbsp;

- There are numerous options available using npm with OneEntry to link your frontend application.

- The functionality of the system is constantly increasing so you can ride with OneEntry to build your imagination in this ever-evolving tech world.

&nbsp;

## What can you build with OneEntry using Headless CMS?

- E-commerce platforms that want to provide their content on different platforms.

- Corporate websites that need to quickly update content without revising the entire site.

- You can create portfolios, making forms and managing content easier, especially for designers or artists who aren't into coding.

For developers, there are helpful YouTube playlists from the OneEntry team to guide you in creating the software you want

These playlists help with `error page`, `catalog`, `product page`, `search & filter`, `related products`, `content localization`, `menu`, and more.

## 2. [Headless Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/headless)

It feels a bit strange talking about Hashnode on DEV. LOL! Jokes aside.

You can supercharge your custom-built blog with Headless Hashnode.

You can kickstart your blog your way.
You can even deploy it on any domain or sub-paths like `/blog`.
And here are a few other benefits:

- There are no restrictions on API calls, meaning unlimited API usage.

- Read more on [API Docs](https://apidocs.hashnode.com/) that uses GraphQL APIs

- They also provide Next.js + Tailwind [starter kit](https://github.com/Hashnode/starter-kit) with a pre-optimized foundation. You can see the [demo](https://demo.hashnode.com/engineering)

![Feature rich](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ozdgv9vjaifirl97qx2.png)

They also offer a markdown WYSIWYG editor, Hashnode AI, and dynamic webhooks for real-time actions such as instant notifications and content backup—basically automated solutions.

![more features](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/osxl0uxaetu9ubuyob09.png)

- But what stands out and proves to be incredibly helpful is the optimized CDN delivery and built-in newsletter functionality.

![cdn delivery and newsletter functionality](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5n3rl7oqfkuxta71zvb6.png)

To be honest, it deserves a separate article to cover everything. 

It's free for individuals, open source, and non-profit projects. Kudos to the Hashnode team for supporting the ecosystem!
