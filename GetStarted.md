> This is a step-by-step guide on how to set up your repository, get the API key from DEV, add it, and every other mandatory step before you can use the workflow.

## Generate DEV API key

The first step is to generate a `dev.to` API token.

Once you are logged into your DEV account, go to [dev.to/settings/extensions](https://dev.to/settings/extensions) 

In the `DEV API Keys` section, create a new key by adding a description and clicking on `Generate API Key`.

![DEV API KEY](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/DevSync/assets/74038190/a654edc3-9a21-4737-93e2-3cb0f761c585)

You'll see the newly generated key in the same view.

Store this key and proceed to the next step.

## Create a Repository

You can follow official documentation on [how to create a repository on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). I will explain, even if you don't want to.

Sign in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/), select `+` in the upper right corner, and then click `new repository`.

![new repository](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/DevSync/assets/74038190/5d977197-b461-4dee-b188-a63452ea2313)

Fill in details and type a name for your repository with an optional description.

You can choose `private` if you don't want others to access your posts or reading list saved in the repository. Other things like `LICENSE` are optional. It's up to you if you want to include it.

## Setup Repository

You still need to provide `write` permissions to this token so that it can push changes to your repository.

To do this, go to repository `settings > Actions > General > Workflow` permissions and select `Read and Write Permissions`.

Here is a screenshot of how you can find it.

After you have granted your token the write permissions, you are all set to proceed to the next step.

To do this, go to `settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` and then click on `New Repository Secret`.

![repository secret](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/DevSync/assets/74038190/56e39242-d6aa-4881-8176-86545b63c919)

Now you have to put the name as `DEV_TOKEN` (used in workflow) and `Secret` as the API key you generated earlier from DEV.

Hooray ðŸŽ‰ You're all set! You can see [examples]() on what options you can choose from.
